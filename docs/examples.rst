========

The pysat framework reduces the steps needed when performing certain science
data investigations. It allows you to focus on developing routines that make
your investigation unique, and creating the output data or visualizations you
require. This section provides examples, with the full code for each example,
as well as additional examples, made available in the
`pysatTutorials <https://github.com/pysat/pysatTutorials>`_ repository.
