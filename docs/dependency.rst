Using pysat as a dependency
===========================

Instrument Libraries
--------------------
Say you are developing an instrument library under the name ``customLibrary``,
which has two instrument objects. A minimalist structure for the library
could look something like:

.. code::

  .
  |--customLibrary
  |   |-- docs
  |   |   `-- tutorial.rst
  |   |-- instruments
  |   |   |-- __init__.py
  |   |   |-- lib_inst1.py
  |   |   |-- lib_inst2.py
  |   |-- tests
  |   |   |-- __init__.py
  |   |   `-- test_instruments.py
  |   `-- __init__.py
  |-- README.md
  `-- setup.py


The instruments folder includes a file for each instrument object.  The
requirements for structuring each of the instruments is discussed in
:ref:`new_inst`.  The __init__ file in this folder should import the instruments
and construct a list of instruments to aid in the testing.

.. code:: python

    from customLibrary.instruments import lib_inst1, lib_inst2

    __all__ = ['lib_inst1', 'lib_inst2']

The tests folder contains an empty __init__ file to be compliant with ``pytest``
and the test_instruments script.  Pysat includes a standard suite of instrument
tests to run on instruments.  These are imported from the ``instrument_test_class``
in the main pysat test library.  The ``test_instruments.py`` file can be copied
directly into the library, updating the instrument library name as indicated.

The ``setup.py`` file should include pysat as a dependency, as well as any
other packages required by the instruments.

A more complicated structure could include analysis routines,
like the `pysatModels <https://github.com/pysat/pysatModels>`_ package.
The structure then could look like:

.. code::

  .
  |--customLibrary
  |   |-- docs
  |   |   `-- tutorial.rst
  |   |-- instruments
  |   |   |-- __init__.py
  |   |   |-- lib_inst1.py
  |   |   |-- lib_inst2.py
  |   |-- tests
  |   |   |-- __init__.py
  |   |   `-- test_instruments.py
  |   |-- utils
  |   |   |-- __init__.py
  |   |   |-- compare.py
  |   |   `-- contrast.py
  |   `-- __init__.py
  |-- README.md
  `-- setup.py

Using pysat to test your instruments
------------------------------------

A generalized instrument test class is provided under ``pysat.tests`` for
developers.  Continuing the above example, developers may copy over the
``test_instruments.py`` file and update it in a few locations.  For example

.. code:: python

  # Make sure to import your instrument library here
  import customLibrary
  # Import the test classes from pysat
  from pysat.tests.instrument_test_class import generate_instrument_list
  from pysat.tests.instrument_test_class import InstTestClass

  # Developers for instrument libraries should update the following line to
  # point to their own library location
  # e.g.,
  # instruments = generate_instrument_list(inst_loc=mypackage.instruments)
  instruments = generate_instrument_list(inst_loc=customLibrary.instruments)

The above code scans the list of instruments and flags each instrument for one
or more of the test types, as defined below.  This bit of the code should
generally be unchanged.  Instruments are grouped in three lists:
- instruments['names']: A list of all module names to check for standardization
- instruments['download']: A list of dicts containing info to initialize instruments
  for end-to-end testing
- instruments['no_download']: A list of dicts containing info to initialize
  instruments without download support for specialized local tests

.. code:: python

  # The following lines apply the custom instrument lists to each type of test
  method_list = [func for func in dir(InstTestClass)
                 if callable(getattr(InstTestClass, func))]
  # Search tests for iteration via pytestmark, update instrument list
  for method in method_list:
      if hasattr(getattr(InstTestClass, method), 'pytestmark'):
          # Get list of names of pytestmarks
          Nargs = len(getattr(InstTestClass, method).pytestmark)
          names = [getattr(InstTestClass, method).pytestmark[j].name
                   for j in range(0, Nargs)]
          # Add instruments from your library
          if 'all_inst' in names:
              mark = pytest.mark.parametrize("inst_name", instruments['names'])
              getattr(InstTestClass, method).pytestmark.append(mark)
          elif 'download' in names:
              mark = pytest.mark.parametrize("inst_dict", instruments['download'])
              getattr(InstTestClass, method).pytestmark.append(mark)
          elif 'no_download' in names:
              mark = pytest.mark.parametrize("inst_dict",
                                             instruments['no_download'])
              getattr(InstTestClass, method).pytestmark.append(mark)

Finally, the ``setup`` function under the ``TestInstruments`` class should be
updated with the location of the instrument subpackage.

.. code:: Python

  class TestInstruments(InstTestClass):

      def setup(self):
          """Runs before every method to create a clean testing setup."""
          # Developers for instrument libraries should update the following line
          # to point to the location of the subpackage
          # e.g.,
          # self.inst_loc = mypackage.instruments
          self.inst_loc = customLibrary.instruments

      def teardown(self):
          """Runs after every method to clean up previous testing."""
          del self.inst_loc


Testing custom analysis routines
--------------------------------

What if you are developing analysis routines or instruments with special
functions?  Pysat includes a series of test instrument objects that can
be imported by other packages to test those functions.  For instance,
`pysatModels <https://github.com/pysat/pysatModels>`_ contains a series of
routines to collect similar measurements between instruments and models.
The test instruments are used as part of the unit tests.  This allows us to
thoroughly test routines without including a large volume of data as part of
the package.

**pysat_testing:**
The basic test object.  Returns a satellite-like object with 1D data as a
function of latitude, longitude, and altitude in a pandas format.  Most similar
to in situ data.

**pysat_testing_xarray:**
Returns a satellite-like object with 1D data as a
function of latitude, longitude, and altitude in a xarray format.

**pysat_testing2d:**
Another satellite-like object that also returns profile data as a function of
altitude at some distance from the satellite.  Similar to a Radio Occultation
or other profile isntruments.

**pysat_testing2d_xarray:**
A satellite-like object that returns all of the above plus an imager-like
dataset, ie, remote data that is a function of x and y.

**pysat_testmodel:**
An xarray obejct that returns a 4D object as a function of latitude, longitude,
altitude, and time.  Most resembles datasets from geophysical models.

These objects return dummy "data" values that are either constants or small
periodic variations.  The intent of these objects are to return data sets
that resemble instrument data in scope.

A very basic example is shown below.  Here a "stats" library is imported from
the custom instrument.  The "dummy1" variable is a simple data set that returns
values between 0 and 20.

.. code:: python

  import pysat

  from customLibrary import stats

  class TestCompare:

    def setup(self):
        self.inst = pysat.Instrument(platform='pysat', name='testing')
        self.inst.load(2009, 1)

    def teardown(self):
        del self.inst

    def test_stats_mean(self):
        mean_val = stats.mean(inst['dummy1'])
        assert mean_val == 11.3785

The ``setup`` function is used to define and load a fresh instrument for each
test.

Tips and Tricks
---------------

Remember to include pysat as a dependency in your setup.py file.

The CI environment will also need to be configured to install pysat and its
dependencies.  You may need to install pysat from github rather than pip if
you need a specific development branch.
