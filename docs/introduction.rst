Introduction
============

Every scientific instrument has unique properties though the general process for
science data analysis is independent of platform. Find and download the data,
write code to load the data, clean the data, apply custom analysis functions,
and plot the results. The Python Satellite Data Analysis Toolkit (pysat)
provides a framework for this general process that builds upon these
commonalities to simplify adding new instruments, reduce data management
overhead, and enable instrument independent analysis routines. Though pysat was
initially designed for in-situ satellite based measurements it aims to support
all instruments in space science.

This document covers installation, a tutorial on pysat including demonstration
code, coverage of supported instruments, an overview of adding new instruments
to pysat, and an API reference.
