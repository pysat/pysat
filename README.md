The Python Satellite Data Analysis Toolkit (pysat) provides a simple and
flexible interface for robust data analysis from beginning to end - including
downloading, loading, cleaning, managing, processing, and analyzing data.
Pysat's plug-in design allows analysis support for any data, including user
provided data sets. The pysat team provides a variety of plug-ins to support
public scientific data sets in packages such as pysatNASA, pysatMadrigal, and
more, available as part of the general [pysat ecosystem](https://github.com/pysat).

in the 'About' section of the
[pysat GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/pysat/pysat)
Development meetings are generally held fortnightly.

# Main Features
* Instrument independent analysis routines.
* Instrument object providing an interface for downloading and analyzing a wide
  variety of science data sets.
  * Uses pandas or xarray for the underlying data structure;
    capable of handling the many forms scientific measurements take in a
    consistent manner.
  * Standard scientific data handling tasks (e.g., identifying, downloading,
    and loading files and cleaning and modifying data) are built into the
    Instrument object.
  * Supports metadata consistent with the netCDF CF-1.6 standard. Each variable
    has a name, long name, and units. Note units are informational only.
* Simplifies data management
  * Iterator support for loading data by day/file/orbit, independent of data
    storage details.
  * Orbits are calculated on the fly from loaded data and span day breaks.
  * Iterate over custom seasons
* Supports rigorous time-series calculations that require spin up/down time
  across day, orbit, and file breaks.
* Includes helper functions to reduce the barrier in adding new science
  instruments to pysat

# Installation

The following instructions provide a guide for installing pysat and give some
examples on how to use the routines.

## Prerequisites

pysat uses common Python modules, as well as modules developed by and for the
Space Physics community.  This module officially supports Python 3.9+.

| Common modules | Community modules |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| dask           | netCDF4           |
| numpy >= 1.12  |                   |
| pandas         |                   |
| portalocker    |                   |
| pytest         |                   |
| scipy          |                   |
| toolz          |                   |
| xarray         |                   |


## PyPi Installation
```
pip install pysat
```


## GitHub Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/pysat/pysat.git
```

Change directories into the repository folder and run the pyproject.toml or
setup.py file.  For a local install use the "--user" flag after "install".

```
cd pysat/
python -m build .
pip install .
```

# Using pysat

* The first time pysat is run, you will need to specify a directory to store
  the data. In Python, run:
```
pysat.params['data_dirs'] = 'path/to/directory/that/may/or/may/not/exist'
```
  * Nominal organization of data is top_dir/platform/name/tag/inst_id/files

Detailed examples and tutorials for using pysat are available in the
[documentation](http://pysat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
