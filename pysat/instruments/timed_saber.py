"""Supports the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry
(SABER) instrument on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics
Dynamics (TIMED) satellite.

SABER "Rules of the Road" for DATA USE
Users of SABER data are asked to respect the following guidelines

    - Mission scientific and model results are open to all.
    - Guest investigators, and other members of the scientific community or
      general public should contact the PI or designated team member early in an
      analysis project to discuss the appropriate use of the data.
    - Users that wish to publish the results derived from SABER data should
      normally offer co-authorship to the PI, Associate PI or designated team
      members. Co-authorship may be declined. Appropriate acknowledgement of
      institutions, personnel, and funding agencies should be given.
    - Users should heed the caveats of SABER team members as to the
      interpretation and limitations of the data. SABER team members may insist
      that such caveats be published, even if co-authorship is declined. Data
      and model version numbers should also be specified.
    - Pre-prints of publications and conference abstracts should be widely
      distributed to interested parties within the mission and related projects.
