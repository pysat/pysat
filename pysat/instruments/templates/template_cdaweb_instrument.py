"""This is a template for a pysat.Instrument support file that
utilizes CDAWeb methods. Copy and modify this file as needed when adding a
new Instrument to pysat.

This is a good area to introduce the instrument, provide background
on the mission, operations, instrumenation, and measurements.

Also a good place to provide contact information. This text will
be included in the pysat API documentation.

Parameters
----------
platform : string
    *List platform string here*
name : string
    *List name string here*
sat_id : string
    *List supported sat_ids here*
tag : string
    *List supported tag strings here*
