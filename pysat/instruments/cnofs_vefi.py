"""Supports the Vector Electric Field Instrument (VEFI)
onboard the Communication and Navigation Outage Forecasting
System (C/NOFS) satellite. Downloads data from the
NASA Coordinated Data Analysis Web (CDAWeb).

Description from CDAWeb:

The DC vector magnetometer on the CNOFS spacecraft is a three axis, fluxgate
sensor with active thermal control situated on a 0.6m boom.  This magnetometer
measures the Earth's magnetic field using 16 bit A/D converters at 1 sample per
sec with a range of .. 45,000 nT.  Its primary objective on the CNOFS
spacecraft is to enable an accurate V x B measurement along the spacecraft
trajectory.  In order to provide an in-flight calibration of the magnetic field
data, we compare the most recent POMME model (the POtsdam Magnetic Model of the
Earth, http://geomag.org/models/pomme5.html) with the actual magnetometer
measurements to help determine a set of calibration parameters for the gains,
offsets, and non-orthogonality matrix of the sensor axes.  The calibrated
magnetic field measurements are provided in the data file here. The VEFI
magnetic field data file currently contains the following variables:
B_north   Magnetic field in the north direction
B_up      Magnetic field in the up direction
B_west    Magnetic field in the west direction

The data is PRELIMINARY, and as such, is intended for BROWSE PURPOSES ONLY.
