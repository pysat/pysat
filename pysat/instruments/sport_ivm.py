    This routine is called as needed by pysat. It is not intended
    for direct user interaction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fnames : array-like
        iterable of filename strings, full path, to data files to be loaded.
        This input is nominally provided by pysat itself.
    tag : string
        tag name used to identify particular data set to be loaded.
        This input is nominally provided by pysat itself.
    sat_id : string
        Satellite ID used to identify particular data set to be loaded.
        This input is nominally provided by pysat itself.
    **kwargs : extra keywords
        Passthrough for additional keyword arguments specified when
        instantiating an Instrument object. These additional keywords
        are passed through to this routine by pysat.

    Returns
    -------
    data, metadata
        Data and Metadata are formatted for pysat. Data is a pandas
        DataFrame while metadata is a pysat.Meta instance.

    Note
    ----
    Any additional keyword arguments passed to pysat.Instrument
    upon instantiation are passed along to this routine and through
    to the load_netcdf4 call.

    Examples
    --------
    ::
        inst = pysat.Instrument('sport', 'ivm')
        inst.load(2019,1)

    This routine is invoked by pysat and is not intended for direct use by
    the end user.

    Multiple data levels may be supported via the 'tag' input string.
    Currently defaults to level-2 data, or L2 in the filename.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tag : string ('')
        tag name used to identify particular data set to be loaded.
        This input is nominally provided by pysat itself.
    sat_id : string ('')
        Satellite ID used to identify particular data set to be loaded.
        This input is nominally provided by pysat itself.
    data_path : string
        Full path to directory containing files to be loaded. This
        is provided by pysat. The user may specify their own data path
        at Instrument instantiation and it will appear here.
    format_str : string (None)
        String template used to parse the datasets filenames. If a user
        supplies a template string at Instrument instantiation
        then it will appear here, otherwise defaults to None.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.Series
        Series of filename strings, including the path, indexed by datetime.

    Examples
    --------
    ::
        If a filename is SPORT_L2_IVM_2019-01-01_v01r0000.NC then the template
        is 'SPORT_L2_IVM_{year:04d}-{month:02d}-{day:02d}_' +
        'v{version:02d}r{revision:04d}.NC'

    Note
    ----
    The returned Series should not have any duplicate datetimes. If there are
    multiple versions of a file the most recent version should be kept and the
    rest discarded. This routine uses the pysat.Files.from_os constructor, thus
    the returned files are up to pysat specifications.
