"""Supports the Planar Langmuir Probe (PLP) onboard the Communication
and Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite. Downloads
data from the NASA Coordinated Data Analysis Web (CDAWeb).

Description from CDAWeb:

The Planar Langmuir Probe on C/NOFS is a suite of 2 current measuring sensors
mounted on the ram facing surface of the spacecraft.  The primary sensor is an
Ion Trap (conceptually similar to RPAs flown on many other spacecraft) capable
of measuring ion densities as low as 1 cm-3 with a 12 bit log electrometer.
The secondary senor is a swept bias planar Langmuir probe (Surface Probe)
capable of measuring Ne, Te, and spacecraft potential.

The ion number density is the one second average of the ion density sampled at
either 32, 256, 512, or 1024 Hz (depending on the mode).

The ion density standard deviation is the standard deviation of the samples
used to produce the one second average number density.

DeltaN/N is the detrened ion number density 1 second standard deviation divided
by the mean 1 sec density.

The electron density, electron temperature, and spacecraft potential are all
derived from a least squares fit to the current-bias curve from the Surface
Probe.

The data is PRELIMINARY, and as such, is intended for BROWSE PURPOSES ONLY.
